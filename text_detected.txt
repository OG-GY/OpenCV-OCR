    Handout" 3 Introduction to Graphs

INTRODUCTION •ro GRAPHS

Graph theory plays an role in several areas Of computer

science such as:

switching tl•coty and logical design

artificial intelligence

formal languages

computer gnpllics

Operating systems

compiler writing

information organization retrieval.

A graph is a non•empty set of points called set of line segments joining

pairs Of verlices called edges.

Formally, a graph G consists Of two finite Sets:

(i) A set V'V(G) of venices (or points or nodes)

(ii)A set of edges; where each edge corvespond5 to a pair Of venices.

The graph G With

V(G)— v', v', vd and

L An edge connects cither one or two vertices called its endpoints (edge e, connects

vertices and v, described as v:} i.e and v: are the endpoints of an edge

2. An edge with just one endpoint is called a loop. •nus a loop is an edge that connects a

vertex to itself (e.g.. edge e, makes a loop as it has only one endpoint

3. Two vertices that are connected by an edge are called adjacent; and a vertex that is

an endmyint ofa loop is said to be adjacent to itself.

4. An edge is said to be incident on each of its endpoints(i.e. e, is incident on VI and v:

5. A vertex on which no edges are incident is called isolated (e.g., v')

6. Two distinct edges with the same set of end points are said to be parallel (i.e. e: &
